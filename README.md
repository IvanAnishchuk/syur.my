ZKML runtime based on loGKR proof system

I'm looking into implementing next generation ZKML proof system (currently focusing on LoGKR), I don't have any money to pay the hackers or resources besides myself but I think I have a good thing going. I won't be inviting investors on this unless I have to but I'm accepting donations and grants in any form. I'm undergoing the best training available on these topics (from Kung Fu masters at Antalfa and Invisible Garden partners, besides my formal education and 15+ years of professional experience) and have the best mentors, if I don't have to find a job to sustain myself I might produce some good results for the world.

Basically right I'm researching the ways to adapt LogUp + GKR proof system to be used in a ML inference runtime which is something that has already successfully been done for ZK-VMs (e.g. Jolt) and has some cryptographic tooling for acceleration and has some research and even reference implementations (zkCNN, zkLLM are both slightly different but can be used as good examples) so it's only a matter of implementing a good middle layer between research cryptography + acceleration libraries on one hand and ML inference runtimes and their acceleration tech on the other.

Integrations are something I'm personally good at, last fifteen years of my career was spend integrating various pieces and bits of tech and I can quickly learn advanced concepts of ZK cryptography and any advanced ML acceleration to figure out the most practical way to optimise the bottlenecks. I can hack this, it's only a matter of time and resources. Open to offers, donations, grants, invites, talks but ideally I want to build it the way I want and let it be free for the world to use (dedicating all my personal contributions to public domain or licensing openly/freely whichever is better) and prioritize types of support that's aligned with that vision.
